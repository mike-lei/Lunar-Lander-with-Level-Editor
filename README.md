# Lunar Lander Game with Level Editor

The player guides a spaceship to a designated landing area using WASD. If the spaceship lands with a speed faster than the limit, or the spaceships hits the terrain, then landing fails and the player needs to try again. There is a fuel limit: once fuel runs out, the spaceship starts to fall and the player has no way to stop it.

The game also has a level editor: the player can edit the terrain, the position of the landing area and the initial position of the spaceship by dragging them. The level editor supports undo/redo feature.
